# deno-intro
Simple web server built with Deno, Hono and Oak frameworks.


## Things I like about Deno
- Built-in Typescript support
- No need to compile TS to JS in order to run
- Implements web standard APIs that exist in front-end JavaScript, like the `fetch` API available in the global scope. (can ditch axios!)
- No node modules!
- Fetch uses streaming by default

## Things I like about Hono

## Things I like about Oak
- Easy to write middleware
- Simple context object instead of req and res

## Things I do not like about Oak
